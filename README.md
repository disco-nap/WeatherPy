# WeatherPy

This challenge uses Python requests, APIs, and JSON

The Python script visualizes the weather of 500 randomly selected cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. It calls on a simple Python library, and the OpenWeatherMap API.

There are 4 plots that are created and saved as .png files. 

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

The data used is also saved as a .csv file so you can verify which cities were selected each time.
